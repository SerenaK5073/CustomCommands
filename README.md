# CustomCommands

Custom commands is my bot for the use of discord it is coded in V11.5.1 and I am not updating for the reason that I do not have the
knowledge of the newer discord versions. If you think you can update the bot do so. But you can not use the bot and not credit me. There
is serious copyright on my bot and has been. I have regitered also to the Top.gg website so we can prove it was my bot. We can prove this 
also by the creation date of the application and also when it was refistered. Again do not copy my work and then proceed to not credit me 
for it.
